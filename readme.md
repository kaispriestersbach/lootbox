# Lootbox Animation Simulator

A sophisticated lootbox animation simulator that mirrors the high-gloss openings from **Counter-Strike 2** and **PUBG: Battlegrounds**. Spin up perfectly weighted RNG sequences or orchestrate scripted reveals for stream theatrics — all without spending a cent.

## 📦 Repository Layout

- `frontend/` – React + Vite single-page app that houses the simulator, animation timelines, and loot tables.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the provided URL (default `http://localhost:5173`) to begin. Switch games, choose between *True Random* and *Scripted Reveal*, and trigger fully animated openings.

Refer to [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md) for a deeper tour, production build steps, and authoring guidance for new loot tables.
