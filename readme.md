# Lootbox Animation Simulator

A **sophisticated lootbox animation simulator** for different games, starting with **Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)** and **PUBG**.

## üéÆ About the Project

This project aims to recreate the thrill of opening loot boxes in popular online games.  
The simulator mimics the **visuals and animations** of real loot box openings, including the anticipation and randomness of obtaining virtual items.

### Key Features
- **Authentic Animations**: Visually identical to original loot box opening sequences.  
- **Randomized Draws**: Simulate the real experience of getting random skins, items, and rewards.  
- **Item Library**: Browse all possible items in advance and pre-select one to be "drawn."  
- **Streamer-Friendly**: Use the simulator in live streams to entertain your audience or prank your friends.  
- **Free & Safe**: Enjoy the fun of loot box openings without spending real money.

## üöÄ Roadmap
- [ ] Implement CS2 lootbox opening animation  
- [ ] Add PUBG lootbox system  
- [ ] Expand to other popular games (TBD)  
- [ ] Build item library and customization options  
- [ ] Provide easy integration for stream overlays  

## üí° Purpose

The purpose of this simulator is twofold:
1. **Entertainment without cost**: Open loot boxes just for fun, receiving random items like in the real games.  
2. **Pre-determined reveals**: Select an item from the library and make it appear in the animation, e.g., for **live stream entertainment** or to **trick your friends**.
